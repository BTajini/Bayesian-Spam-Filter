# Bayesian Spam Filter

###### NOTE: PROJECT IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. EVEN THIS README MIGHT BE WRONG!!

###### NOTE 2: DATA SETS HAVEN'T BEEN INCLUDED YET, WILL DO SO SOON.

An implementation of a Spam Filter in Python that uses the Naive Bayes Model to classify emails as spam or ham.

The program uses a small portion of NLTK to tokenize and clean out the "noise" words that may appear across the text.

Do check back for updates!! Thank you!!
